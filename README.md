# PowerBi Portifolio

I have highlighted some (3) of my recent works that might help in demonstrating my understanding in using Excel and Power BI. 
I selected the works based on their data source and reporting frequency i.e. (Project “1” is connecting into Azure SQL and it’s reporting frequency is monthly whereas Project “2” reporting frequency is Quarterly and its data source is DHIS 2 using a DHIS2 connector and lastly Project “3” is a weekly based report whose data source is an Excel file residing in SharePoint).
Both Project numbered 1-3 have detailed explanations and sample files that have also been attached in this portfolio. 
The Project sample folders are named 
- ProjectP1 
- ProjectP2 
- ProjectP3

| 1.	Monthly Report template
Description/Challenge:
This was a report in excel that was done by the Monitoring and Evaluation team manually by combining different excel files (using index matching mainly) into a single one and send it to the donor for reporting every month
Solution:
To facilitate reporting on time and ensuring data integrity, Power BI was used by getting data required from the Azure SQL and exporting it into excel using the analyse in Excel feature. The excel was produced to reflect the standard template they were previous using which was achieved by using pivots and cube formulas to link the excel file and the power BI dataset so that whenever new data is available in excel, the excel user simply clicks the refresh button to get in the new data. The sample excel file in question is attached as part of the file “Project P1”
                                                                      |   - Requirements gathering from the users
 - Working as part of a team of 2 (incl. my self), getting data into Power BI, data modelling, and exporting it into Excel format via the Analyse in Excel feature.
-	Adding cube formulas in the respective columns for the excel file as each column corresponds to a specific measure in Power BI
 - User orientation on the usage of the excel file
