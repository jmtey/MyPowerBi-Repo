I have highlighted some (3) of my works that might help in demonstrating my understanding in using Excel and Power BI. 
I selected the works based on their data source and reporting frequency i.e. (Project “1” is connecting into Azure SQL and it’s reporting frequency is monthly whereas Project “2” reporting frequency is Quarterly and its data source is DHIS 2 using a DHIS2 connector and lastly Project “3” is a weekly based report whose data source is an Excel file residing in SharePoint).
Both Project numbered 1-3 have detailed explanations and sample files that have also been attached in this portfolio. 
The Project sample folders are named 
- ProjectP1 
- ProjectP2 
- ProjectP3

Please read the document titled *"My PBI Data Visualization Portifolio"* for further explanation on the projects.
